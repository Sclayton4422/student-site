<h2>Expectations and policies</h2>

<p>
    All students are expected to follow school wide and classroom rules. This means that I will expect you to arrive on time for class, come, be ready to work, and be willing to participate. Please bring all the school materials to class with you and follow directions the first time they are given to you. Please keep a positive and upbeat attitude in class, this will greatly affect your learning experience.
    I will always treat you with the respect that you deserve, and I expect the same from you. All rules established in the school handbook are enforced.
    You are not just a class, but a team please be always respectful to others as well as the teacher and be sure to work together to minimize any attempts at breaking the rules and maximize efforts to help build class moral.
    Learning a language takes time with a lot of studying and practice, attendance is critical to passing this course. Please refer to the attendance policy in the handbook. If for any reason you cannot attend school, it will be your responsibility to retrieve any notes or assignments. Please be sure to check the BCHS website or Google Classroom for notes and assignments.
    Parents are always welcome to contact me either through e-mail, the remind app or give me a call through the school landline. I will be happy to answer any questions and address any concerns.
    Learning a second language can be hard and confusing and it is my duty as a teacher to be challenging yet fair, hold high expectations that have a sense of understanding and always be available to you for questions and concerns. Your duty as a student is to make every possible effort to excel in earning the grade you want. I'm not looking for perfection, only looking for positive outcomes.
